☀️ Summer Projects

Hey! These are my summer projects — a collection of my data science, machine learning, and analytics projects** developed during my summer learning journey.  
This repository brings together multiple hands-on projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, modeling, automation, and visualization.


 🧠 Projects Included
Here are some of the featured projects you'll find in this repository:

- 🧮 Anomaly Detection (SQL) – Detecting irregular patterns and outliers in datasets.  
- 📈 Automated Reporting – Generating and scheduling analytical reports automatically.  
- ☁️ Hyperparameter Tuning on GCP – Optimizing ML models using Google Cloud Platform.  
- 🗞️ Topic Modeling (NMF) – Extracting topics and insights from text data.  
- 🧩 Text Classification – Implementing NLP techniques for multi-class classification.  
- 🤖 Trading Bot – An experimental trading algorithm using data-driven insights.  
- 🧹 BigQuery Cleanup Scripts – Automating data maintenance and cleanup tasks.  
- 📊 Miscellaneous Analytics Projects – Additional notebooks for visualization and experimentation.



🧰 Tech Stack

Languages:
- Python  
- SQL  

Libraries & Frameworks:
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- NLTK, SpaCy (for NLP projects)

Tools & Platforms:
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  
- BigQuery  
- Visual Studio Code  



🎯 Objectives

- Consolidate all summer learning and data science projects in one repository.  
- Demonstrate end-to-end workflows from data collection → processing → modeling → insights.  
- Build a portfolio that reflects practical applications of data science and AI concepts.  
- Encourage learning and sharing through clean, reusable project examples.
