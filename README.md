# ☀️ Summer Projects

Welcome to **summer_projects** — a collection of my **data science, machine learning, and analytics projects** developed during my summer learning journey.  
This repository brings together multiple hands-on projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, modeling, automation, and visualization.

## 🧠 Projects Included
Here are some of the featured projects you'll find in this repository:

- 🧮 **Anomaly Detection (SQL)** – Detecting irregular patterns and outliers in datasets.  
- 📈 **Automated Reporting** – Generating and scheduling analytical reports automatically.  
- ☁️ **Hyperparameter Tuning on GCP** – Optimizing ML models using Google Cloud Platform.  
- 🗞️ **Topic Modeling (NMF)** – Extracting topics and insights from text data.  
- 🧩 **Text Classification** – Implementing NLP techniques for multi-class classification.  
- 🤖 **Trading Bot** – An experimental trading algorithm using data-driven insights.  
- 🧹 **BigQuery Cleanup Scripts** – Automating data maintenance and cleanup tasks.  
- 📊 **Miscellaneous Analytics Projects** – Additional notebooks for visualization and experimentation.
